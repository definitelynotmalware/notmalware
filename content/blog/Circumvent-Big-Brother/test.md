description: "Bypass Some of HonorLocks Invasive Practices"
---

This post will be updated for the most up to date ways to circumvent Honorlock's invasive practices. 

##1
The easiest way to bypass a good amount of honolock restrictions is by running it in a VM (Virtual Machine). You can do this by downloading [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org), and using your university credentials to get a copy of windows which you can then setup with virtual box. (We will update this with step by step guide and links). This method bypasses Chrome restictions imposed by Honorlock.

##2
You can circumvent the IP tracking and some of its honeypots by using a vpn service. (We will test some VPNs to see which bypass the IP Tracking effectively and update this post.)
