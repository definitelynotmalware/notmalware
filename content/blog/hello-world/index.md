Over the last few months, the world has undergone an immense change with the spread of coronavirus. While some of these changes are positive or necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus or ensure the overall function of society, the requirement of certain universities for students to install anti-cheating software is most certainly not one of these changes. We are focused specifically on Honorlock here, but there are plenty of other instances of this kind of software including proctorU, proctorio, and many others.

We created this website for the purpose of spreading information about Honorlock, and possible methods by which to circumvent the program. While we do not endorse cheating, we believe that students have a right to privacy, and that is not being respected with these online proctoring services.

Our goal is to help students convince their schools that Honorlock or similar online proctoring services are not only unnecessary, but harmful to students, and to get these schools to stop endorsing and using online proctoring services. We believe that universities charging tens of thousands of dollars in tuition fees should be able to find a better solution to possible academic dishonesty than to force their students to install spyware. On top of all of this, there are problems that this software may create with minority students and students who may require accommodations when being tested.

If you, like us, believe that these online proctoring services are problematic, stay tuned as we will be posting soon about how these services work, why these services are problematic, and how people could possibly circumvent these online proctoring services.
